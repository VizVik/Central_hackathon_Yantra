        <h2>Problem Statement:</h2><hr>
        <p>Agricultural productivity is critical for sustaining a growing global population while addressing environmental challenges. However, unsustainable farming practices, monocropping, and inefficient crop rotation patterns have led to significant degradation of soil health, reduced yields, and increased carbon emissions. Farmers face challenges in determining optimal crop rotation strategies that balance short-term economic gains with long-term sustainability.

            Crop rotation, a proven practice to improve soil fertility and mitigate the effects of climate change, remains underutilized due to the complexity of factors involved. These include variations in soil properties, climatic conditions, water availability, carbon sequestration potential, and the impact of crops on greenhouse gas emissions. Without adequate decision-support systems, farmers are left to rely on traditional knowledge or generic recommendations that fail to account for regional and temporal variations. This results in suboptimal productivity, increased environmental degradation, and missed opportunities for carbon footprint reduction.</p>

        <h2>Solution Overview:</h2><hr>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                To address these challenges, we propose the development of a <span class="highlight">Smart Crop Rotation Optimization System</span> powered by AI and ML. The system will provide farmers with tailored recommendations for both <span class="highlight">short-term plans</span> (seasonal crop choices) and <span class="highlight">long-term strategies</span> (multi-year rotation schedules), ensuring sustainable agricultural practices.
